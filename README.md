urwvn-ttf
=========

This is an update of the [urwvn-ttf](http://vntex.sourceforge.net/fonts/urwvn-ttf/) fonts.

## Changes
* fixed name inconsistency
* in previous version sometimes the accents are cut off due to wrong font metrics; this version has the font metrics corrected.
* added hints by ttfautohint, which improves font rendering very much, especially at low resolution

## TODO
* add some font samples
* add install instructions
