urwvn-ttf
=========

This is an update of the [urwvn-ttf](http://vntex.sourceforge.net/fonts/urwvn-ttf/) fonts.

## Changes
* fixed name inconsistency;
* in previous version sometimes the accents are cut off due to wrong font metrics; this version has the font metrics corrected;
* added hints by ttfautohint, which improves font rendering very much, especially at low resolution;
* added 2 fonts that were not included in vntex due the license restrictions: VnGaramond & VnURWClassico (aka Optima)

## TODO
* add some font samples
* add install instructions
